# ✈️ Airline Passenger Sentiment & Flight Performance Analysis  
**Focus: Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA)**  

This project merges sentiment analysis of airline passengers with a performance-driven evaluation of flight operations—offering a dual-layered insight into the aviation ecosystem, specifically focusing on JKIA.  

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The aviation industry faces two key challenges: **operational inefficiencies** and **passenger dissatisfaction**. This project aims to tackle both by:

- Analyzing **passenger sentiment** using advanced NLP techniques (BERT).
- Uncovering **flight performance trends** such as delays and bottlenecks.
- Generating **data-driven insights** to support improved service delivery and operational efficiency at airports, particularly JKIA.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis Using BERT**: Understand how passengers feel about airport experiences based on social media, reviews, or survey data.
- **Flight Performance Analysis**:
  - Delay patterns by carrier, route, time, and season.
  - Frequent sources of delays and operational inefficiencies.
- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - Airline performance comparisons.
  - Airport and route-level delay analytics.
- **Insightful Visualizations**: Highlight trends, patterns, and outliers using modern data visualization libraries.
- **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for airport management and airline operations teams.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment
- **Transformers (BERT)** – Natural Language Processing for sentiment classification

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

To run the project locally:

1. **Install Python & Jupyter Notebook** (if not already installed).
2. **Install required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn transformers torch
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run `Flight analysis.ipynb` and `Passenger_Sentiment_BERT.ipynb`.

## 📈 Results Summary

- **Temporal Delay Patterns**: Flight delays peak during specific months and early evening hours.
- **Airline Performance**: Some carriers are significantly more efficient than others.
- **Airport Bottlenecks**: Routes involving JKIA show patterns of recurrent delays.
- **Passenger Sentiment**:
  - Positive sentiment correlates with efficient operations.
  - Negative sentiment frequently relates to delays, poor communication, or baggage issues.
